I am currently a second-year PhD student at [Department of Earth Sciences](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/earth-sciences/) at University College London (UCL). I’m supervised by **Dr Michel Tsamados**, **Dr Rosemary Willatt**, **Dr So Takao** and **Prof Marc Deisenroth**. I’m also affiliated with [Data Intensive Science CDT](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/data-intensive-science-industry) 2023 Cohort at UCL. 

Before my PhD, I completed my undergraduate degree in the Department of Statistical Science at UCL. My undergraduate thesis is about **Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning with (Bi-) Harmonic Functions and Gaussian Random Fields**. 

My research focuses on **sea ice remote sensing**, leveraging **remote sensing**, **machine learning**, and **statistical learning** techniques to advance our understanding of polar regions and climate change.
